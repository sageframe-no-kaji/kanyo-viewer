## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

### Prerequisites on kanyo.lan
- Docker and docker-compose installed
- Clip directories at:
  - `/opt/services/kanyo-harvard/clips/`
  - `/opt/services/kanyo-nsw/clips/`
- SSH access configured

### Deployment Steps

1. **Initial setup on kanyo.lan:**
   ```bash
   ssh kanyo.lan
   cd /opt/services
   git clone <repo-url> kanyo-viewer
   cd kanyo-viewer
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

2. **Future updates (from local machine):**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-viewer.sh
   # or
   make deploy
   ```

3. **Access:**
   - http://kanyo.lan:3000

## 📋 Configuration

### Streams
Edit `backend/streams.yaml` to add/modify streams:

```yaml
streams:
  harvard:
    name: "Harvard Falcon Cam"
    youtube_id: "glczTFRRAK4"
    data_path: "/data/harvard"
    timezone: "America/New_York"
    display:
      short_name: "Harvard"
      location: "Memorial Hall, Harvard University, Cambridge MA"
      species: "Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus)"
      maintainer: "Harvard Faculty of Arts & Sciences"
      telegram_channel: "kanyo_harvard_falcon"
```

### Data Structure Expected
```
/data/{stream_id}/clips/
  ├── YYYY-MM-DD/
  │   ├── events_YYYY-MM-DD.json
  │   ├── falcon_HHMMSS_arrival.mp4
  │   ├── falcon_HHMMSS_arrival.jpg
  │   ├── falcon_HHMMSS_departure.mp4
  │   └── falcon_HHMMSS_departure.jpg
```
